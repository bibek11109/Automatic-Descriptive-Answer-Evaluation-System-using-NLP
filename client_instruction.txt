## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP SETUP GUIDE

### Step 1: Extract the Project
1. **Download** the `bibek_FYP.zip` file from your instructor
2. **Extract** the zip file to your desired location (e.g., Desktop, Documents)
3. **Note the path** where you extracted the folder (you'll need this later)

### Step 2: Open in Visual Studio Code
1. **Launch Visual Studio Code**
2. **Click** on "File" → "Open Folder"
3. **Navigate** to the extracted `bibek_FYP` folder
4. **Select** the `bibek_FYP` folder and click "Open"
5. You should now see the project files in the VS Code sidebar

### Step 3: Set Up the Backend (Python/Flask)

#### 3.1 Install Python Dependencies
1. **Open Terminal** in VS Code:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+` (macOS)
   - Or go to "Terminal" → "New Terminal"

2. **Navigate to the backend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   
   **Note**: You'll know it's activated when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

5. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

#### 3.2 Start the Backend Server
1. **Make sure you're in the backend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Wait for the startup message**. You should see:
   ```
   ✅ Database initialized!
   🚀 ADAES Backend Server Starting...
   📍 Server: http://localhost:5001
   ```

4. **Keep this terminal window open** - the backend server is now running

### Step 4: Set Up the Frontend (React)

#### 4.1 Open a New Terminal
1. **Open a new terminal** in VS Code (Terminal → New Terminal)
2. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

#### 4.2 Install Node.js Dependencies
1. **Install npm packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Wait for installation to complete** (this may take a few minutes)

3. **Important**: If you see security vulnerabilities, **DO NOT** run `npm audit fix --force` as it can break the application. The vulnerabilities are usually in development dependencies and don't affect functionality.

#### 4.3 Start the Frontend Server
1. **Start the React development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Wait for the application to compile**. You should see:
   ```
   Compiled successfully!
   Local:            http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **The browser should automatically open** to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### Backend Issues:
1. **"Port 5001 already in use"**:
   - Close any other applications using port 5001
   - Or change the port in `backend/app.py` (line 628)

2. **"Module not found" errors**:
   - Make sure you're in the correct virtual environment
   - Reinstall requirements: `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`

3. **"sqlite3" installation error**:
   - This is normal! sqlite3 is built into Python
   - The error can be safely ignored
   - Continue with the next steps

4. **"Command not found: venvScriptsactivate"** (macOS/Linux):
   - Use `source venv/bin/activate` instead of `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - The backslash command is for Windows only

5. **"NameError: name 'model' is not defined"**:
   - This is a known bug that has been fixed
   - If you encounter this, the backend code needs to be updated
   - Contact your instructor for the latest version

6. **Database errors**:
   - Delete `backend/adaes.db` and restart the backend
   - The database will be recreated automatically

#### Frontend Issues:
1. **"Port 3000 already in use"**:
   - Close other React applications
   - Or press 'Y' when prompted to use a different port

2. **"npm install" fails**:
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Delete `node_modules` folder and try again

3. **"react-scripts: command not found"**:
   - This happens if `react-scripts` was accidentally removed
   - Reinstall react-scripts: `npm install react-scripts`
   - Or reinstall all dependencies: `npm install`

4. **"npm audit fix --force" removed packages**:
   - **DO NOT** run `npm audit fix --force` as it can break the application
   - If you already ran it, reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
   - The vulnerabilities are usually in development dependencies and don't affect functionality

5. **"Cannot connect to backend"**:
   - Ensure the backend server is running on port 5001
   - Check if both servers are running simultaneously

#### General Issues:
1. **Slow performance**:
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Ensure stable internet connection for initial setup

2. **Permission errors** (macOS/Linux):
   - Use `sudo` if necessary for system-wide installations
   - Or use a virtual environment (recommended)
